### Follow-up Questions
**1.** I the color chose #e2e2e2 (226, 226, 226) for my fill color because it was light enough to not draw the eye towards it to not look to heavy, but had enough tint to help it visually recede into the background. For my outline color I chose #808080 (128, 128, 128) because the shade was about 9 shades darker than the fill color according to ColorHexa. This ensured high contrast. For the label color I chose #454545 (69,69,69) because it was around six shades darker than the outline color, but wasn't so dark it appeared black.

**2.** For map 2 I used the *5-class Orange* single hue sequential color scheme because it is color blind and LCD friendly. Because this color ramp starts so light and ends in a very deep orange it is easy to see the areas of the state with the highest population density.

**3.** For map 2 it was appropriate to normalize the population counts by square kilometers of each county because it gives a more accurate representation of the population densities of the Missouri counties than using raw data.

**4.** For map 3 I used the multi-hue sequential color scheme *4-class GnBu* because it is color blind and LCD friendly. I made the fill of the background layer *County Outlines* the same as the fill of the surrounding states to avoid confusing that fill color for a 5th class. The darkest colors represented the counties with the highest number of unemployed veterans in relation to the number of veterans residing in the county. Having the darker color represent a higher number of unemployed veterans makes the map easy to decipher at a glance.

**5.** Normalizing the number of unemployed veterans in a county by the total number of veterans in the same county gives a clearer picture of the overall distribution. Without normalizing the data a county with a veteran population of 200,000 having 300 unemployed veterans would be mapped the same as a county with 300 of their 500 veterans unemployed.

**6.** For map 4 I chose the divergent color scheme *5-class BrBG* to display the number of vacant housing units in each county in relation to the number of existing housing units in the same county. I chose this color scheme because the directions indicated that the warmest color should represent the highest numeric value range. All of the other options that were color blind and LCD friendly had rather cool "warm" colors. I'm not a fan of this type of color scheme in this context because I believe it's difficult to guess what it's saying just by looking at it unlike the other types of color ramps seen in this problem set.

**7.** Normalizing by total number of housing units helps better represent the true number of vacant housing units. Without normalizing it rural areas would appear to have very few vacancies, and more populated, urban areas would appear to have many more vacancies than they truly do.
